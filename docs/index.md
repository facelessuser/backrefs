# Backrefs {: .doctitle}
Additional back References for regular expressions.

---

## Overview
Backrefs is a wrapper around Python's built-in **re** and/or the 3rd party **regex** library.  Backrefs adds various additional back references that are known to some regex engines, but not to Python's **re** or **regex**.  The supported back references actually vary depending on the regular expression engine being used as the engine may already have support for some.
