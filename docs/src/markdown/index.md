# User Guide

## Overview

Backrefs is a wrapper around Python's built-in [Re][re] and the 3rd party [Regex][regex] library.  Backrefs adds various additional back references (and a couple other features) that are known to some regular expression engines, but not to Python's Re and/or Regex.  The supported back references actually vary depending on the regular expression engine being used as the engine may already have support for some.

## Using Backrefs

Depending on which regular expression engine you are using (Re or Regex), you can import the appropriate module.

```py3
from backrefs import bre
from backrefs import bregex
```

Backrefs can be applied to search patterns and/or replace patterns. You can control whether you want to use search augmentation, replace augmentation, or both.

### Search Patterns

To augment the search pattern to utilize search back references, you can use Backrefs to compile the search. This will apply a preprocessor to the pattern and replace the back references (and related pattern portions) with the appropriate content to construct a valid regular expression for Re or Regex and will return a valid compiled pattern for the respective regular expression engine. Since the return is a valid compiled pattern, you can use it as expected.

```py3
pattern = bre.compile_search(r'\p{Letter}', bre.UNICODE)
m = pattern.match('whatever')
```

### Replace Templates

Backrefs also provides special back references for replace templates as well. In order to utilize these back references, the template string must be run through a compiler as well. The replace compiler will run a preprocessor on the replace template that will strip out the back references and augment the template accordingly creating a valid replace template. Then it will return a replace function that will properly augment and insert matched groups (according to rules of the originally included back references) into the template.  These replace functions can be passed into `sub` and `subn` if desired.

Search templates must be run through the compiler with an associated compiled search pattern that can be compiled with the regular expression engine directly or with Backrefs.  The search pattern is needed to resolve groups in the search template.

```pycon3
>>> pattern = bre.compile_search(r'(\p{Letter}+)')
>>> replace = bre.compile_replace(r'\C\1\E')
>>> text = pattern.sub(replace, 'sometext')
SOMETEXT
```

Since compiled replaces are not template strings, but functions, you wont be able to apply compiled replaces via `#!py m.expand(replace)`. Instead, you can use the compiled replace directly.

```pycon3
>>> pattern = bre.compile_search(r'(\p{Letter}+)')
>>> replace = bre.compile_replace(r'\C\1\E')
>>> m = pattern.match('sometext')
>>> replace(m)
SOMETEXT
```

If you have a one time expand, and don't feel like pre-compiling, you can use Backrefs `expand` method (it can also take pre-compiled patterns as well).

```pycon3
>>> pattern = bre.compile_search(r'(\p{Letter}+)')
>>> m = pattern.match('sometext')
>>> bre.expand(m, r'\C\1\E')
SOMETEXT
```

### Search & Replace wrappers

If you have a one time `finditer`, `match`, `sub`, `search`, or other match, search, or replace operation, Backrefs provides wrappers for these methods just as it does with expand.  The wrappers will compile the search and replace patterns for you on the fly, but they will also accept and pass pre-compiled patterns through as well.  They should take all the flags and options your chosen regular expression engine accepts with the same names and positions.

```pycon3
>>> bre.sub(r'(\p{Letter}+)', r'\C\1\E', 'sometext')
SOMETEXT
```

In general, all options and flags for any of the compile, search, or replace wrappers should be the same as your actual regular expression engine.  They are mirrored in the `bre` and `bregex` library to save you from having to import the the original `re` and `regex` respectively, but you could just as easily use the original flags if desired.

In order to escape patterns formulated for Backrefs, you can simply use your regular expressions built-in escape method or the one mirrored in Backrefs; they are the same.

```pycon3
>>> pattern = bre.compile_search(bre.escape(r'(\p{Letter}+)'))
>>> bre.sub(pattern, 'found it!', '(\\p{Letter}+)')
'found it!'
```

### Format Replacements

!!! note "Backrefs' Format Differences"
    Even though this is a Regex specific feature, this replace format is supported by Backrefs for both Regex *and* Re with some slight differences.  These differences apply to both Regex as well as Re as Backrefs must augment the format to allow casing back references.

    1. Backrefs does not implement true format replace strings, but the functionality feels the same in regards to specifying groups and captures within a group.
    2. Indexing into different captures in Re is limited to `0` or `-1` since Re *only* maintains the last capture.
    3. While you can access the `subf` and `subfn` methods directly from a match object or via Backrefs' provided wrappers in Regex, you *must* use Backrefs' provided wrappers for Re as Re does not natively support such a feature.
    3. Raw string (`#!py3 r"..."`) handling for format replace is a bit different for Backrefs compared to Regex. Regex treats format strings as simply strings instead of as a regular replace template. So while in a regular replace template you can use `\n` to represent a new line, in format strings, you'd have use a literal new line or use a normal string (`!#py3 "..."`) with `\n`. Backrefs will actually process back references and format references.

The Regex module offers a feature where you can apply replacements via a format string style.

```pycon3
>>> regex.subf(r"(\w+) (\w+)", "{0} => {2} {1}", "foo bar")
'foo bar => bar foo'
>>> regex.subf(r"(?P<word1>\w+) (?P<word2>\w+)", "{word2} {word1}", "foo bar")
'bar foo'
```

You can even index into groups that have multiple captures.

```pycon3
>>> regex.subf(r"(\w)+ (\w+)", "{0} => {2} {1[0]}", "foo bar")
'foo bar => bar f'
```

Backrefs supports this functionality in a similar way, and you can do it with Regex *or* Re. This allows you to use case back references and the format style replacements.


```pycon3
>>> bre.subf(r"(\w+) (\w+)", r"{0} => \C{2} {1}\E", "foo bar")
'foo bar => BAR FOO'
>>> bre.subf(r"(?P<word1>\w+) (?P<word2>\w+)", r"\c{word2} \c{word1}", "foo bar")
'Bar Foo'
```

And `{} {}` is the same as `{0} {1}`.

```pycon3
>>> bre.subf(r"(\w+) (\w+)", r"{} => \C{} {}\E", "foo bar")
'foo bar => FOO BAR'
```

To pre-compile a format replace template, you can use the Backrefs' `compile_replace` method with the `FORMAT` flag.

```pycon3
>>> pattern = bre.compile_search(r"(\w+) (\w+)")
>>> replace = bre.compile_replace(pattern, r"{0} => {2} {1}", bre.FORMAT)
>>> m = pattern.match("foo bar")
>>> replace(m)
'foo bar => bar foo'
```

Backrefs also provides an `expand` variant for format templates called `expandf`.

```pycon3
>>> pattern = bre.compile_search(r"(\w+) (\w+)")
>>> m = pattern.match('foo bar')
>>> bre.expandf(m, r"{0} => {2} {1}")
'foo bar => bar foo'
```

## Search Back References

Added features available for search patterns. Features are broken up to show what is specifically added for Re and for Regex.

### Re

Back\ References      | Description
--------------------- |------------
'\e'                  | Escape character `\x1b`.
`\c`                  | Uppercase character class.  ASCII or Unicode when re Unicode flag is used.  Can be used in character classes `[]`.
`\l`                  | Lowercase character class.  ASCII or Unicode when re Unicode flag is used.  Can be used in character classes `[]`.
`\C`                  | Inverse uppercase character class.  ASCII or Unicode when re Unicode flag is used.  Can be used in character classes `[]`.
`\L`                  | Inverse lowercase character class.  ASCII or Unicode when re Unicode flag is used.  Can be used in character classes `[]`.
`\Q...\E`             | Quotes (escapes) text for regular expression.  `\E` signifies the end of the quoting. Affects any and all characters no matter where in the regular expression pattern it is placed.
`\p{UnicodeProperty}` | Unicode property character class. Can be used in character classes `[]`. See [Unicode Properties](#unicode-properties) for more info.
`\pX`                 | Unicode property character class where `X` is the uppercase letter that represents the General Category property.  For instance, `\pL` would be equivalent to `\p{L}` or `\p{Letter}`.
`\P{UnicodeProperty}` | Inverse Unicode property character class. Can be used in character classes `[]`. See [Unicode Properties](#unicode-properties) for more info.
`\PX`                 | Inverse Unicode property character class where `X` is the uppercase letter that represents the General Category property. For instance, `\PL` would be equivalent to `\P{L}` or `\P{Letter}`.
`[[:alnum:]]`         | Though not really a back reference, support for Posix style character classes is available. See [Posix Style Properties](#posix-style-properties) for more info.
`\N{UnicodeName}`     | Named characters are are normally ignored in Re, but Backrefs adds support for them.

### Regex

Back\ References | Description
---------------- | -----------
'\e'             | Escape character `\x1b`.
`\Q...\E`        | Quotes (escapes) text for regular expression.  `\E` signifies the end of the quoting. Affects any and all characters no matter where in the regular expression pattern it is placed.
`\R`             | Generic line breaks. When searching a Unicode string, this will use an atomic group and match `(?>\r\n|\n|\x0b|\f|\r|\x85|\u2028|\u2029)`, and when applied to byte strings, this will match `(?>\r\n|\n|\x0b|\f|\r|\x85)`. Because it uses atomic groups, which Re does not support, this feature is only for Regex.

## Replace Back References

Added features available for replace patterns. None of the replace back references can be used in character classes `[]`.  The references below apply to both Re **and** Regex.

Back&nbsp;References | Description
---------------------|-------------
`\c`                 | Uppercase the next character.
`\l`                 | Lowercase the next character.
`\C...\E`            | Apply uppercase to all characters until either the end of the string or the end marker `\E` is found.
`\L...\E`            | Apply lowercase to all characters until either the end of the string or the end marker `\E` is found.
`\U`                 | Wide Unicode character `\U00000057`. Re doesn't translate this notation in raw strings (`r"..."`), and Regex doesn't in format templates in raw strings (`r"{} {}"`).  This adds support for them.
`\u`                 | Narrow Unicode character `\u0057`. Re doesn't translate this notation in raw strings (`r"..."`), and Regex doesn't in format templates in raw strings (`r"{} {}"`).  This adds support for them.
`\x`                 | Byte character `\x57`. Re doesn't translate this notation in raw strings (`r"..."`), and Regex doesn't in format templates in raw strings (`r"{} {}"`).  This adds support for them.
`\N{UnicodeName}`    | Named characters are are normally ignored in Re, but Backrefs adds support for them.

!!! tip "Tip"
    Complex configurations of casing should work fine.

    - `\L\cTEST\E` --> `Test`
    - `\c\LTEST\E` --> `Test`
    - `\L\cTEST \cTEST\E` --> `Test Test`

## Unicode Properties

!!! note "Note"
    Unicode Properties are only added to Re as Regex already has **full** Unicode properties built in (on both wide and narrow builds).

There are quite a few properties that are also supported and an exhaustive list is not currently provided. This documentation will only briefly touch on `General_Category`, `Block`, `Script`, and binary properties.

Unicode properties can be used with the format: `\p{property=value}`, `\p{property:value}`, `\p{value}`, `\p{^property=value}`, `\p{^value}`. Unicode properties can be used in byte strings, but the patterns will be restricted to the range `\x00-\xff`.

The inverse of properties can also be used to specify everything not in a Unicode property: `\P{value}` or `\p{^value}` etc.  They are only used in the search patterns. Only one property may specified between the curly braces.  If you want to use multiple properties, you can place them in a character class: `[\p{UnicodeProperty}\p{OtherUnicodeProperty}]`.

When specifying a property, the value matching is case insensitive and characters like `[ -_]` will be ignored.  So the following are all equivalent: `\p{Uppercase_Letter}`, `\p{Uppercase-letter}`, `\p{UPPERCASELETTER}`, `\p{upper case letter}`.

When evaluating a property in the form `\p{value}`, they are evaluated in this order:

1. General Category
2. Script
3. Blocks
4. Binary

All other properties are namespaced.  Example: `\p{Bidi_Class: White_Space}`.

When installed, the Unicode version that comes with the Python it is installed under will be used to generate all the Unicode tables.  For instance, Python 2.7 is currently using Unicode 5.2.0.  And Python 3.5 is using 8.0.0.

!!! caution "Narrow Python Builds"
    If you are using a narrow python build, your max Unicode value will be `\uffff`.  Unicode blocks above that limit will not be available.  Also Unicode values above the limit will not be available in character classes either.

    If you are using a wide build, you should have access to all Unicode values. If you are on a narrow build and need full Unicode ranges, you should consider using the Regex module.

### General Category

General categories can be specified in one of three ways: `\p{gc: value}`, `\p{General_Category: value}`, `\p{value}` etc.  Again, case is not important.  See the table below to see all the Unicode category properties that can be used.

Verbose\ Property\ Form            | Terse\ Property\ Form
---------------------------------- | ------------------------------
 `Other`                           | `C`

 `Mark`                            | `M`
 `Nonspacing_Mark`                 | `Mc`
 `Spacing_Mark`                    | `Me`
 `Enclosing_Mark`                  | `Md`
 `Number`                          | `N`
 `Decimal_Number`                  | `Nd`
 `Letter_Number`                   | `Nl`
 `Other_Number`                    | `No`
 `Punctuation`                     | `P`
 `Connector_Punctuation`           | `Pc`
 `Dash_Punctuation`                | `Pd`
 `Open_Punctuation`                | `Ps`
 `Close_Punctuation`               | `Pe`
 `Initial_Punctuation`             | `Pi`

 `Symbol`                          | `S`
 `Math_Symbol`                     | `Sm`
 `Currency_Symbol`                 | `Sc`
 `Modifier_Symbol`                 | `Sk`
 `Other_Symbol`                    | `So`
 `Separator`                       | `Z`
 `Space_Separator`                 | `Zs`
 `Line_Separator`                  | `Zl`
 `Paragraph_Separator`             | `Z`

### Blocks

There are a number of Unicode blocks and also aliases for blocks (they won't be listed here), but they can be specified in two ways: `\p{Block: Basic_Latin}` or `\p{InBasic_Latin}`.

### Scripts

There are a number of Unicode scripts and also aliases for scripts (they won't be listed here), but they can be specified in two ways: `\p{Script: Latin}` or `\p{IsLatin}`.

### Binary

There are a number of binary properties and even aliases for some of the binary properties.  Comprehensive lists are available on the web, but they are specified in the following way: `\p{Alphabetic}`.  Normal just specifying inverse via `\P{value}` or `\p{^value}` should be enough, but for completeness the form `\p{Alphabetic: Y}` and `\p{Alphabetic: N}` along with all the variants (Yes|No|T|F|True|False).

### Posix

A number of Posix property names are also available.  In general, when used in the `\p{}` form, they are aliases for existing Unicode properties with the same name. There are some Posix names that aren't used in the current Unicode properties such as `alnum`, `xdigit`, etc.  If you want to force the Posix form inside `\p{}` you can use their name prefixed with `posix`: `\p{Punct}` --> `\p{PosixPunct}` (these `posix` prefixed properties are treated as binary properties)  Currently when using Posix values in `\p{}` they will be forced into their Unicode form (see [Posix Style Properties](#posix-style-properties) for more info).

## Posix Style Properties

Posix properties in the form of `[:posix:]` and the inverse `[:^posix:]` are available. Posix style properties are supported in byte string and Unicode string searches. These character classes are only available inside a character group `[]`.  If needed, you can use the alternate form of `\p{Posix}` to use inside and outside a character group.

If the search pattern is a byte string or the `UNICODE` flag is not included (or `ASCII` flag is include), the ASCII variant will be used.  Unicode variants are used for Unicode strings with the Unicode flag (which is the default in Python 3).

!!! caution "Posix Values in `p{}`"
    If using the `\p{Posix}` form, the return will always be Unicode and properties like `punct` will revert to the Unicode property form opposed the Posix unless `posix` is prefixed to the name.  Example: the Unicode property `punct` = `[\p{P}]`, but the Posix `posixpunct` = `[\p{P}\p{S}]`.

\[:posix:] | \\p\{Posix} | ASCII                                             | Unicode
