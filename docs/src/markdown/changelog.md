# Changelog

## 4.0.0

- **NEW**: Drop support for new features in Python 2. Python 2 support is limited to the 3.X.X series and will only receive bug fixes up to 2020. All new features moving forward will be on the 4.X.X series and will be for Python 3+ only.

## 3.6.0

- **NEW**: Make version available via the new, and more standard, `__version__` attribute and add the `__version_info__` attribute as well. Deprecate the old `version` and `version_info` attribute for future removal.

## 3.5.2

- **FIX**: Include zip for Unicode 11 (Python 3.7) to make installation more reliable.

## 3.5.1

- **FIX**: POSIX character classes should not be part of a range.
- **FIX**: Replace string casing logic properly follows other implementations like Boost etc. `\L`, `\C`, and `\E` should all terminate `\L`, and `\C`. `\l` and `\c` will be ignored if followed by `\C` or `\L`.

## 3.5.0

- **NEW**: Use a more advanced format string implementation that implements all string features, included those found in `format_spec`.
- **FIX**: Relax validation so not to exclude valid named Unicode values.
- **FIX**: Caching issues where byte string patterns were confused with Unicode patterns.
- **FIX**: More protection against using conflicting string type combinations with search and replace.

## 3.4.0

- **NEW**: Add support for generic line breaks (`\R`) to Re.
- **NEW**: Add support for an overly simplified form of grapheme clusters (`\X`) to Re. Roughly equivalent to `(?>\PM\pM*)`.
- **NEW**: Add support for `Vertical_Orientation` property for Unicode 10.0.0 on Python 3.7.

## 3.3.0

- **NEW**: Add support for `Indic_Positional_Category`\\`Indic_Matra_Category` and `Indic_Syllabic_Category` properties.

## 3.2.1

- **FIX**: `Bidi_Paired_Bracket_type` property's `None` value should be equivalent to all characters that are not `open` or `close` characters.

## 3.2.0

- **NEW**: Add support for `Script_Extensions` Unicode properties (Python 3 only as Python 2, Unicode 5.2.0 does not define these). Can be accessed via `\p{scripts_extensions: kana}` or `\p{scx: kana}`.
- **NEW**: When defining scripts with just their name `\p{Kana}`, use `Script_Extensions` instead of `Scripts`. To get `Scripts` results, you must specify `\p{scripts: kana}` or `\p{sc: scripts}`.
- **NEW**: Add `Bidi_Paired_Bracket_Type` Unicode property (Python 3.4+ only).
- **NEW**: Add support for `IsBinary` for binary properties: `\p{IsAlphabetic}` == `\p{Alphabetic: Y}`.
- **FIX**: Tweaks/improvements to string iteration.

## 3.1.2

- **FIX**: Properly escape any problematic characters in Unicode tables.

## 3.1.1

Feb 11, 2018

- **FIX**: `bregex.compile` now supports additional keyword arguments for named lists like `bregex.compile_search` does.

## 3.1.0

- **NEW**: Start and end word boundary back references are now specified with `\m` and `\M` like Regex does.  `\<` and `\>` have been removed from Regex.
- **FIX**: Escaped `\<` and `\>` are no longer processed as Re is known to escape these in versions less than Python 3.7.

## 3.0.5

- **FIX**: Process non raw string equivalent escaped Unicode on Python 2.7.
- **FIX**: Compiled objects should return the pattern string, not the pattern object via the property `pattern`.

## 3.0.4

- **FIX**: Formally enable Python 3.7 support.
- **FIX**: Tweak to Unicode wide character handling.

## 3.0.3

- **FIX**: Compiled search and replace objects should be hashable.
- **FIX**: Handle cases where a new compiled pattern object is passed back through compile functions.

## 3.0.2

- **FIX**: Bregex purge was calling Re's purge instead of Regex's purge.

## 3.0.1

- **FIX**: Do not accidentally `\.` as a group in replace strings (don't use `isdigit` string method).
- **FIX**: Group names can start with `_` in replace strings.
- **FIX**: Do not rely on Re for parsing string.
- **FIX**: Match behavior in `\g<group>` parsing better.
- **FIX**: Raise some exceptions in a few places we weren't.

## 3.0.0

- **NEW**: Added new `compile` function that returns a pattern object that feels like Re's and Regex's pattern object.
- **NEW**: Add some caching of search and replace patterns.
- **NEW**: Completely refactored algorithm for search and replace pattern augmentation.
- **NEW**: Add support for `\e` for escape character `\x1b` in both Re and Regex.
- **NEW**: Add support for `\R` for generic newlines in the Regex module (Regex only).
- **NEW**: Support Unicode property form `\pP` and `\PP`.
- **NEW**: Add support for properly handling per group, scoped verbose flags in the preprocess step (Regex).
- **NEW**: Handle `(?#comments)` properly in the preprocess step.
- **NEW**: Add support for `\N` in byte strings (characters out of range won't be included).
- **NEW**: Add support for `\p` and `\P` in byte strings (characters out of range won't be included).
- **NEW**: Add support for `\<` and `\>` word boundary escapes.
- **FIX**: Missing block properties on narrow systems when the property starts beyond the narrow limit.
- **FIX**: Fix issue where an invalid general category could sometimes pass and return no characters.
- **FIX**: Fix `\Q...\E` behavior so it is applied first as a separate step. No longer avoids `\Q...\E` in things like character groups or comments.
- **FIX**: Flag related parsing issues in Regex and Re Python 3.6+.

## 2.2.0

- **NEW**: Proper support for `\N{Unicode Name}`.
- **FIX**: Incomplete escapes will not be passed through, but will instead throw an error. For instance `\p` should only be passed through if it is complete `\p{category}`.  Python 3.7 will error on this if we pass it through, and Python 3.6 will generate warnings.  We should just consistently fail on it for all Python versions.

## 2.1.0

- **NEW**: Handle Unicode and byte notation in Re replace templates.
- **NEW**: Rework algorithm to handle replace casing back references in Python 3.7 development builds in preparation for Python 3.7 release.
- **NEW**: Add support for case back references when using the Regex module's `subf` and `subfn`.
- **NEW**: Add new convenience method `expandf` to Regex that can take a format string and apply format style replaces.
- **NEW**: Add `FORMAT` flag to `compile_replace` to apply format style replaces when applicable.
- **NEW**: Add the same support that Regex has in relation to format style replacements to Re.
- **NEW**: Compiled replacements are now immutable.
- **NEW**: Various logic checking proper types and values.
- **FIX**: Fix octal/group logic in Regex and Re.
- **FIX**: Fix issue dealing with trailing backslashes in replace templates.

## 2.0.0

- **NEW**: First attempt at bringing Python 3.7 support, fixing back reference logic, and adding new back reference. Released and then removed due to very poor behavior.

## 1.0.2

- **FIX**: Issues related to downloading Unicode data and Unicode table generation. Include Unicode data in release.

## 1.0.1

- **FIX**: Fixes for Python 3.6.

## 1.0.0

- **NEW**: Initial release.
