# Installation

## Overview

Backrefs doesn't have any required external dependencies.  If desired, you can install the optional [Regex][regex] module and use Backrefs with either Python's Re module or the Regex module.

## Installation

There are a couple of recommended ways to install Backrefs.  If you would like to install in a virtual machine, you can do that as well.

1. `#!bash pip install backrefs`

2. Install locally from source via `#!bash python setup.py build` and `#!bash python setup.py install`.

3. If developing Backrefs, you can install via `#!bash pip install --editable .`.  This method will allow you to instantly see your changes without reinstalling which is great for developing.
