## Overview
Backrefs doesn't have any required external dependencies.  If desired, you can install the optional [regex module](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/regex) and use backrefs with either Python's re module or the regex module.

## Installation
There are a couple of recommended ways to install backrefs.  If you would like to install in a virtual machine, you can do that as well.

1. `#!bash pip install backrefs`

2. Install locally from source via `#!bash python setup.py build` and `#!bash python setup.py install`.

3. If developing backrefs, you can install via `#!bash pip install --editable .`.  This method will allow you to instantly see your changes without reinstalling which is great for developing.
