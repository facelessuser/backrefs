# Backrefs

Backrefs is a wrapper around Python's built-in [Re][re] and the 3rd party [Regex][regex] library.  Backrefs adds various additional back references (and a couple other features) that are known to some regular expression engines, but not to Python's Re and/or Regex.  The supported back references actually vary depending on the regular expression engine being used as the engine may already have support for some.
